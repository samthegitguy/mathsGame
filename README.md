# mathsGame
A simple python game to learn maths with the use of levels to regulate the difficulty of the questions asked.
<br>

Users are given a simple menu to select the questions they want to learn.

1 Addition  |  2 Subtraction  |  3 Multiplication  |  4 Division  |  5 Random Operators  |  6 Help  |  7 Quit

Once the user has selected their chosen operator the game will randomly select values to substitue into a question deepending on the users current level. Such as 2 + 3 = ? where the user will be prompted to type the answer and enter.

The random option will cycle randomly between the 4 operators | + | - | * | \ | and again randomly choses values based on the players level.

The player gains levels by completing 3 questions consecutively and loses a level of 3 are incorrect.

The levels are capped at 1 and 4 but could easily be expanded, the game also has error prevention for invalid inputs. If the user types a letter or an invalid number in the menu a mmessage will alert the user to know that it isnt excepted.
